Footnotes:
1,"Average price estimates for these products are derived using transaction data from Canadian grocery retailers. The composition of a given product category may change over time due to evolving consumer purchasing patterns and product availability. Therefore, average prices may not be fully comparable from one month to another and should not be used as a representative measure of pure price change through time. Note: Data are experimental and subject to revision."
2,"For concepts and definitions, see the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m2020008-eng.htm">Methodological Supplement for the Provincial Monthly Average Retail Prices Table</a> publication, available in the Prices Analytical Series (62F0014M). Additional information, including product details, can be obtained from the Consumer Prices Division by email at statcan.cpddisseminationunit-dpcunitedediffusion.statcan@canada.ca."
3,"Specific size - In most cases, a specific size or quantity can be easily identified as the measure of best fit for a particular product. For some products, a specific size or quantity is the most commonly purchased by a considerable amount (for example, 1 dozen eggs). Other products have multiple high-sale sizes over a large range (for example, milk). In this case we calculate separate average prices for each size (1 L, 2 L and 4 L) in order to provide a fuller picture. Other products such as fresh produce and meats are often sold by weight, and provided as a price per kilogram. In these cases, 1 kg is applied as the specific size. For all of these products, only items of the specific size or quantity are included in the average price calculation. The specific size alone provides sufficient coverage to produce a robust measure."
4,"Standardized size - For certain products which are available to consumers in a wide variety of package sizes, prices for products within a set range of package sizes are standardized before the average price calculation. For example, prices for blocks of cheese ranging in size from 400 g to 800 g are adjusted to represent a 500 g block of cheese, and are presented as such in the average prices table."
